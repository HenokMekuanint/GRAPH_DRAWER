# graph_drawer

1. Create an application that can draw two different mathematical functions at the same time with different colors. The user will have different 6 mathematical functions as a choice to be drawn for each graph. This will help me visualize graphs better . 

P.S: Please use graphical input rather than command line. You can use Python TK. If there is any problem, feel free to consult me.
